As a senior analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, you have been asked to analyze the complete data from the company's most recent animal study that used mice as the subjects. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer, received treatment with a range of drug regimens.  The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of the drug Capomulin against other treatment regimens over the course of 45 days.

To perform the analysis, we generated a summary statistics table for each drug used in the study, a bar chart detailing the number of mice tested with each drug, a pie chart that outlined the percentage of males versus females, box plots for four specific drugs, and a scatter plot that compared the average tumor volume to the weight of the mice for Capomulin.  A regression was run on the the scatter plot data.
